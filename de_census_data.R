# Code to API to get data
# One thing to make sure we know is what year we are analayzing. I believe that 2017 so that is the year we are analyzing.
# Future iterations could build on this by adding decennial census data. TidyCensus has the 1990, 2000, and 2010 surveys.
# Another aspect future iterations could also add data from other sources, such as crime statistics from the Uniform Crime Reporting database maintained by the FBI.

## Cleaning Steps
# 1. Split 'NAME' into three separate variables. Currently, data on census tract, county, and state are all contained in same variable.
#    Splitting 'NAME' into 'Census_Tract', 'County', & 'State' provides more opportunities to subset and join data with other datasets.
# 2. After creating a variable for 'Census_Tract', it is neccessary to conduct another split b/c
#    We want to isolate the number of the census tract. We don't want each observation to read 'Census Tract x'
# 3. Next we rename the variable so that it has a clearer meaning

    separate(col = Census_Tract, into = c("Census", "Tract", "Number"), sep = " ") %>%
    setnames(old=c( "Number"), new=c("Census_Tract_Number"))

# Ultimately, we want to create a dataset that combines a bunch of census tract variables.
# Another question I have is about tidy format. Is the data set we are creating in tidy format?

## Food for thought
#What are the variables we'd most want to compare?Do we want to show margin of error? ratios of education to income?
#Could change the estimates to comparison between counties - normalize by subtracting average value
